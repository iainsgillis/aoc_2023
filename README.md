# Taking part in Advent of Code 2023

Haven't done Advent of Code before. Will start with Python, since I use it at
work. Will take the opportunity to use pytest a bit; formatting with black.
Otherwise, standard library only. I think. For now.

Cribbed some of the setup boilerplate from https://github.com/anthonywritescode/aoc2022/.
